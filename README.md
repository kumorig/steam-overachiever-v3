## Building
Make sure you have [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/tools/install/) installed. Then, run:

```bash
cargo run --release
```
or 
```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome. Make a PR or open an issue. 
About half of the code has been "vibe-coded", feel free to help clean-up any mess. AI contributions are welcome, but at least do some low effort testing before submitting a PR. Thanks!

## Roadmap
Feel free to open an issue with requests or suggestions.
- [ ] (important for the future!!): If we ever get a few more users, and more than one user scans at the same time, we will hit rate limits. We should implement some kind of queue. And run a backend service to handle requests. -- Currently if you leave the app, requests will stop, but the backend could keep going. its also a problem to let the client trigger requests indescriminately. 
- [ ] Improve privacy policy parts. It's not very clear what data is stored or sent where.
