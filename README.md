For it to work, you need to provide your Steam API key in a `.env` file in the project root. You can get one from [here](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey) after registering a developer account (free for now).

See `.env.example` for and example of the required format.


## Building
Make sure you have Rust and Cargo installed. Then, run:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome. Make a PR or open an issue. 
About half of the code has been "vibe-coded", feel free to help clean-up where you can. Thus, AI contributions are also welcome, but at least do some low effort testing before submitting a PR. Thanks!
